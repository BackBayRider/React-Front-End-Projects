# Free Code Camp Front-End Curriculum

This repository contains the Intermediate and Advanced Projects from Free Code Camp's Front End Curriculum, all built with React.js. This is a project I did in order to improve my understanding of the React library.

**I used Toggl to record the time spent on each of the projects. The results are:**

1. Random Quote Generator => 1:33:27
2. Weather API Service => 2:24:28
3. Wikipedia Viewer => 3:22:58
4. Twitch API Service => 4:18:52
5. Javascript Calculator => 1:4618
6. Pomodoro Clock&nbsp =>
7. Tic-Tac-Toe Game =>
8. Simon Game =>

**I used analyzed the amount of code required to build each project and compared it to my prior attempt. Here are the results, evaluated simply on the number of characters typed in all the files per project (e.g. all HTMl, CSS, and JS):**
