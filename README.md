# Free Code Camp Front-End Curriculum

##This repository contains the Intermediate and Advanced Projects from Free Code Camp's Front End Curriculum, all built with React.js. This is a project I did in order to improve my understanding of the React library.

###I used Toggl to record the time spent on each of the projects. The results are:

1 - Random Quote Generator  =>
2 - Weather API Service     =>
3 - Wikipedia Viewer        =>
4 - Twitch API Service      =>
5 - Javascript Calculator   =>
6 - Pomodoro Clock          =>
7 - Tic-Tac-Toe Game        =>
8 - Simon Game              =>
