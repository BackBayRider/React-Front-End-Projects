# Free Code Camp Front-End Curriculum

**This repository contains the Intermediate and Advanced Projects from Free Code Camp's Front End Curriculum, all built with React and Sass.** I created these projects after finishing the Front End Curriculum while working on the Data Visualization Certificate in order to improve my understanding of React, and also to improve my workflow in general. This page includes some data I tracked while working on these projects.

**I used Toggl to record the time spent on each of the projects I built with React.** Unfortunately, I do not have any of these numbers for the first time I completed these projects, but I know it took me substantially longer then.

In order to improve my workflow, I created a template (`project-template` folder in the repo) for each project which included a simple project directory and basic HTML, CSS, and JS files setup with boilerplate code (.e.g a root React Component, html title, body, etc.). I also configured my main.scss file with several font-families and colors I pre-selected to have available as variables for each project. Overall, this made my development process much quicker than it otherwise would have been.

| Project | Time |
| ------- | ---- |
| Random Quotes | 1:33:27 |
| Weather API | 2:24:28 |
| Wikipedia Viewer | 3:22:58 |
| Twitch TV | 4:18:52 |
| Javascript Calculator | 1:46:18 |
| Pomodoro Clock | 2:41:33 |
| Tic-Tac-Toe | |

**I also analyzed the amount of code required to build each project and compared it to my prior attempt.** Here are the results, evaluated roughly on the number of characters typed in all the files in each project (e.g. all HTMl, CSS, and JS):

| Project | 1st Try (jQuery) | 2nd Try (React) | Gain or (Loss) on 2nd Try |
| ------- | ---------------: | --------------: | --------------------: |
| Random Quotes | 3,649 characters | 3,878 characters | +229 characters more |
| Weather API | 13,347 characters | 7,937 characters | -5,410 characters less |
| Wikipedia Viewer | 6,788 characters | 6,506 characters | -282 characters less |
| Twitch TV | 5,987 characters | 6,192 characters | -205 characters less |
| Javascript Calculator | 8,497 characters | 6,206 characters | -2291 characters less |
