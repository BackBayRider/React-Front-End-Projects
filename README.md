# Free Code Camp Front-End Curriculum

This repository contains the Intermediate and Advanced Projects from Free Code Camp's Front End Curriculum, all built with React.js. This is a project I did in order to improve my understanding of the React library.

**I used Toggl to record the time spent on each of the projects. The results are:**

1. Random Quote Generator => 1:33:27
2. Weather API Service => 2:24:28
3. Wikipedia Viewer => 3:22:58
4. Twitch API Service => 4:18:52
5. Javascript Calculator => 1:4618
6. Pomodoro Clock&nbsp =>
7. Tic-Tac-Toe Game =>
8. Simon Game =>

**I used analyzed the amount of code required to build each project and compared it to my prior attempt. Here are the results:**

| ------- | ---------------: | --------------: | 
| Random Quotes | first | second |
