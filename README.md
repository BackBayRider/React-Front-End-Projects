# Free Code Camp Front-End Curriculum

This repository contains the Intermediate and Advanced Projects from Free Code Camp's Front End Curriculum, all built with React.js. This is a project I did in order to improve my understanding of the React library.

1. Random Quote Generator  => 1:33:27
2. Weather API Service     => 2:24:28
3. Wikipedia Viewer        => 3:22:58
